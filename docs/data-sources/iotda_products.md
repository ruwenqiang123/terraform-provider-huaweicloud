# huaweicloud_iotda_products

Use this data source to get the list of IoTDA products within HuaweiCloud.

-> When accessing an IoTDA **standard** or **enterprise** edition instance, you need to specify the IoTDA service
  endpoint in `provider` block.
  You can login to the IoTDA console, choose the instance **Overview** and click **Access Details**
  to view the HTTPS application access address. An example of the access address might be
  **9bc34xxxxx.st1.iotda-app.ap-southeast-1.myhuaweicloud.com**, then you need to configure the
  `provider` block as follows:

  ```hcl
  provider "huaweicloud" {
    endpoints = {
      iotda = "https://9bc34xxxxx.st1.iotda-app.ap-southeast-1.myhuaweicloud.com"
    }
  }
  ```
