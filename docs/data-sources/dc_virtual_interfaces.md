# huaweicloud_dc_virtual_interfaces

Use this data source to get the list of DC virtual interfaces.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "direct_connect_id" {}

data "huaweicloud_dc_virtual_interfaces" "test" {
  direct_connect_id = var.direct_connect_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to query the data source.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.

* `virtual_interface_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ID of the virtual interface.

* `name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the name of the virtual interface.

* `status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the status of the virtual interface.

* `direct_connect_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ID of the direct connection associated with the virtual interface.

* `vgw_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ID of the virtual gateway for the virtual interface.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String) Indicates the ID of the enterprise project
  that the virtual interface belongs to.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The data source ID.

* `virtual_interfaces` - Indicates the virtual interfaces list.
  The [virtual_interfaces](#DC_virtual_interfaces) structure is documented below.

* `route_mode` - The route mode of the virtual interface.

* `asn` - The (ASN) number for the local BGP.

* `bgp_md5` - The (MD5) password for the local BGP.

* `tags` - The key/value pairs to associate with the virtual interface.

* `vif_peers` - The peer information of the virtual interface.
  The [vif_peers](#DCDataVirtualInterface_vif_peers) structure is documented below.

<a name="DCDataVirtualInterface_vif_peers"></a>
The `vif_peers` block supports:

* `id` - The VIF peer resource ID.

* `name` - The name of the virtual interface peer.

* `description` - The description of the virtual interface peer.

* `address_family` - The address family type of the virtual interface, which can be **IPv4** or **IPv6**.

* `local_gateway_ip` - The address of the virtual interface peer used on the cloud.

* `remote_gateway_ip` - The address of the virtual interface peer used in the on-premises data center.

* `route_mode` - The routing mode, which can be **static** or **bgp**.

* `bgp_asn` - The ASN of the BGP peer.

* `bgp_md5` - The MD5 password of the BGP peer.

* `device_id` - The ID of the device that the virtual interface peer belongs to.

* `enable_bfd` - Whether to enable BFD.

* `enable_nqa` - Whether to enable NQA.

* `bgp_route_limit` - The BGP route configuration.

* `bgp_status` - The BGP protocol status of the virtual interface peer. If the virtual interface peer uses **static**
  routing, the status is null.

* `status` - The status of the virtual interface peer.

* `vif_id` - The ID of the virtual interface corresponding to the virtual interface peer.

* `receive_route_num` - The number of received BGP routes if **bgp** routing is used. If **static** routing is used,
  this parameter is meaningless and the value is **-1**.

* `remote_ep_group` - The remote subnet list, which records the CIDR blocks used in the on-premises data center.
