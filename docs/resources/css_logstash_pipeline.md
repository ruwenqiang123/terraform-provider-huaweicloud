# huaweicloud_css_logstash_pipeline

Manages CSS logstash cluster pipeline resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "cluster_id" {}
variable "config_file_name" {}

resource "huaweicloud_css_logstash_pipeline" "test" {
  cluster_id = var.cluster_id
  name       = var.config_file_name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the resource.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

* `cluster_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies ID of the CSS logstash cluster.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

* `names` - (Required, List) Specifies the configuration file names of the CSS logstash cluster pipeline.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

* `keep_alive` - (Optional, Bool, ForceNew) Specifies whether keep alive. The value can be **true** and **false**.
  Defaults to **false**. During hot start, the value of keep alive of existing pipelines in the cluster needs to
  be consistent.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

  -> **NOTE:** Keepalive can be enabled for long-running services. Enabling it will configure a daemon process
    on each node. If the Logstash service is faulty, the daemon process will rectify the fault and restart the
    service. Do not enable it for short running services, or your migration tasks may fail due to lack of source data.

* `id` - The resource ID.
