# huaweicloud_apig_endpoint_whitelist

Manage the endpoint service whitelists of APIG instance within HuaweiCloud.

-> There is not need to add a whitelist for the current account. After starting the endpoint service,
  the whitelist of the current account will automatically be added to the whitelists list,
  and this whitelist is not managed by terraform.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_apig_endpoint_whitelist" "test" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  whitelists  = [
    "iam:domain::1cc2018e40394f7c9692f1713e76234d",
    "iam:domain::2cc2018e40394f7c9692f1713e76234d",
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region where the endpoint service is located.  
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `instance_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the dedicated instance to which the endpoint service
  belongs. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `whitelists` - (Required, List) Specifies the whitelists in the endpoint service.
  This is a list of strings. The value must comply with regular validation.
  It consists of two parts, the first part is the fixed format **iam: domain::**, and the second part is the
  enterprise project ID. e.g. **iam:domain::XXX**.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The resource ID (also instance ID).
