* `binary_collect` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether collect in binary format. Default is false.

* `log_split` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to split log. Default is false.

<a name="block_access_config"></a>
The `access_config` block supports:

* `path_type` - (Required, String) Specifies the type of the CCE access. The options are as follows:
  + **container_stdout**
  + **container_file**
  + **host_file**

* `paths` - (Optional, List) Specifies the collection paths. Required when `path_type` is **container_file**
  or **host_file**.

* `black_paths` - (Optional, List) Specifies the collection path blacklist.

* `windows_log_info` - (Optional, List) Specifies the configuration of Windows event logs. Required when
  `path_type` is **container_file** or **container_stdout**.
  The [windows_log_info](#block_access_config_windows_log_info) structure is documented below.

* `single_log_format` - (Optional, List) Specifies the configuration single-line logs. Each log line is displayed
  as a single log event.
  The [single_log_format](#block_access_config_single_log_format) structure is documented below.

* `multi_log_format` - (Optional, List) Specifies the configuration multi-line logs. Multiple lines of exception log
  events can be displayed as a single log event. This is helpful when you check logs to locate problems.
  The [multi_log_format](#block_access_config_multi_log_format) structure is documented below.

 -> `single_log_format` or `multi_log_format` must be specified.

* `stdout` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether output is standard. Default is false.

* `stderr` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether error output is standard. Default is false.

 ->  If the value of `path_type` is **container_stdout**, `stdout` or `stderr` must be **true**.

* `name_space_regex` - (Optional, String) Specifies the regular expression matching of kubernetes namespaces.
  LTS will collect logs of the namespaces with names matching this expression. To collect logs of all namespaces,
  leave this field empty.

* `pod_name_regex` - (Optional, String) Specifies the regular expression matching of kubernetes pods.
  LTS will collect logs of the Pods with names matching this expression. To collect logs of all Pods,
  leave this field empty.

* `container_name_regex` - (Optional, String) Specifies the regular expression matching of kubernetes container names.
  LTS will collect logs of the containers with names matching this expression. To collect logs of all containers,
  leave this field empty.

* `log_labels` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the container label log tag. A maximum of `30` tags can be created.
  The key names must be unique. LTS adds the specified fields to the log when each label key has a corresponding
  label value. For example, if you enter `app` as the key and `app_alias` as the value, when the Container label
  contains `app=lts`, `{app_alias: lts}` will be added to the log.

* `include_labels` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the container label whitelist. A maximum of `30` tags can be created.
  The key names must be unique. If labelValue is empty, all containers whose container label contains labelKey are
  matched. If labelValue is not empty, only containers whose container label contains `LabelKey=LabelValue` are
  matched. LabelKey must be fully matched, and labelValue supports regular expression matching. Multiple whitelists
  are in the OR relationship. That is, a container label can be matched as long as it meets any of the whitelists.

* `exclude_labels` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the container label blacklist. A maximum of `30` tags can be created.
  The key names must be unique. If labelValue is empty, all containers whose container label contains labelKey are
  excluded. If labelValue is not empty, only containers whose container label contains `LabelKey=LabelValue` are
  excluded. LabelKey must be fully matched, and labelValue supports regular expression matching. Multiple blacklists
  are in the OR relationship. That is, a container label can be excluded as long as it meets any of the blacklists.

* `log_envs` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the environment variable tag. A maximum of `30` tags can be created.
  The key names must be unique. LTS adds the specified fields to the log when each environment variable key has a
  corresponding environment variable value. For example, if you enter `app` as the key and `app_alias` as the value,
  when the kubernetes environment variable contains `app=lts`, `{app_alias: lts}` will be added to the log.

* `include_envs` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the environment variable whitelist. A maximum of `30` tags can be
  created. The key names must be unique. LTS will match all containers with environment variables containing either
  an environment variable key with an empty corresponding environment variable value, or an environment variable key
  with its corresponding environment variable value. LabelKey must be fully matched, and labelValue supports regular
  expression matching.

* `exclude_envs` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the environment variable blacklist. A maximum of `30` tags can be
  created. The key names must be unique. LTS will exclude all containers with environment variables containing either
  an environment variable key with an empty corresponding environment variable value, or an environment variable key
  with its corresponding environment variable value. LabelKey must be fully matched, and labelValue supports regular
  expression matching.

* `log_k8s` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the kubernetes label log tag. A maximum of `30` tags can be created.
  The key names must be unique. LTS adds the specified fields to the log when each label key has a corresponding label
  value. For example, if you enter `app` as the key and `app_alias` as the value, when the K8s label contains
  `app=lts`, `{app_alias: lts}` will be added to the log.

* `include_k8s_labels` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the kubernetes label whitelist. A maximum of `30` tags can be
  created. The key names must be unique. If labelValue is empty, all containers whose K8s label contains labelKey are
  matched. If labelValue is not empty, only containers whose K8s Label contains `LabelKey=LabelValue` are matched.
  LabelKey must be fully matched, and labelValue supports regular expression matching. Multiple whitelists are in the
  OR relationship. That is, a K8s label can be matched as long as it meets any of the whitelists.

* `exclude_k8s_labels` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the kubernetes label blacklist. A maximum of `30` tags can be
  created. The key names must be unique. If labelValue is empty, all containers whose K8s label contains labelKey are
  excluded. If labelValue is not empty, only containers whose K8s label contains `LabelKey=LabelValue` are excluded.
  LabelKey must be fully matched, and labelValue supports regular expression matching. Multiple blacklists are in the
  OR relationship. That is, a K8s Label can be excluded as long as it meets any of the blacklists.

 -> These parameters include `name_space_regex`, `pod_name_regex`, `container_name_regex`, `log_labels`,
    `include_labels`, `exclude_labels`, `log_envs`, `include_envs`, `exclude_envs`, `log_k8s`, `include_k8s_labels` and
    `exclude_k8s_labels` are available, only `path_type` is not **host_file**.

<a name="block_access_config_single_log_format"></a>
The `single_log_format` block supports:

* `mode` - (Required, String) Specifies mode of single-line log format. The options are as follows:
  + **system**: the system time.
  + **wildcard**: the time wildcard.

* `value` - (Optional, String) Specifies value of single-line log format.
  + If mode is **system**, the value is the current timestamp, the number of milliseconds elapsed
    since January 1, 1970 UTC.
  + If mode is **wildcard**, the value is **required** and is a time wildcard, which is used to look for
    the log printing time as the beginning of a log event. If the time format in a log event
    is `2019-01-01 23:59:59`, the time wildcard is **YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss**. If the time format in
    a log event is `19-1-1 23:59:59`, the time wildcard is **YY-M-D hh:mm:ss**.

<a name="block_access_config_multi_log_format"></a>
The `multi_log_format` block supports:

* `mode` - (Required, String) Specifies mode of multi-line log format. The options are as follows:
  + **time**: the time wildcard.
  + **regular**: the regular expression.

* `value` - (Required, String) Specifies value of multi-line log format.
  + If mode is **regular**, the value is a regular expression.
  + If mode is **time**, the value is a time wildcard, which is used to look for the log printing time
    as the beginning of a log event. If the time format in a log event is `2019-01-01 23:59:59`, the time
    wildcard is **YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss**. If the time format in a log event is `19-1-1 23:59:59`, the time
    wildcard is **YY-M-D hh:mm:ss**.

-> The time wildcard and regular expression will look for the specified pattern right from the beginning of each
   log line. If no match is found, the system time, which may be different from the time in the log event, is used.
   In general cases, you are advised to select **Single-line** for Log Format and **system** time for Log Time.

<a name="block_access_config_windows_log_info"></a>
The `windows_log_info` block supports:

* `categorys` - (Required, List) Specifies the types of Windows event logs to collect. The valid values are
  **Application**, **System**, **Security** and **Setup**.

* `event_level` - (Required, List) Specifies the Windows event severity. The valid values are **information**,
  **warning**, **error**, **critical** and **verbose**. Only Windows Vista or later is supported.

* `time_offset_unit` - (Required, String) Specifies the collection time offset unit. The valid values are
  **day**, **hour** and **sec**.

* `time_offset` - (Required, Int) Specifies the collection time offset. This time takes effect only for the first
  time to ensure that the logs are not collected repeatedly.

  + When `time_offset_unit` is set to **day**, the value ranges from `1` to `7` days.
  + When `time_offset_unit` is set to **hour**, the value ranges from `1` to `168` hours.
  + When `time_offset_unit` is set to **sec**, the value ranges from `1` to `604,800` seconds.
